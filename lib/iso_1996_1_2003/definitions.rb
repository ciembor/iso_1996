# frozen_string_literal: true

# ISO_1996_1_2003 module implements definitions from ISO 1996-1:2003 standard
# related to acoustics and environmental noise descriptors.
#
# @author Maciej Ciemborowicz
# @version 0.1
# @since 2025-06-26
#
# It includes definitions for:
# - Weighting types (A, C, Z)
# - Sound level metrics (e.g., LAeq, Lden, Lnight)
# - Periods of day (day, evening, night) with penalties
# - Adjustment types (e.g., tonality, impulsiveness)
# - Sound event types (e.g., single, continuous)
# - AcousticDescriptor class linking metric + weighting + description
#
# This module is meant to serve as a base for calculation and analysis tools
# that implement the ISO 1996-1:2003 standard.
